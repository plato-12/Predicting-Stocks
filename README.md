# Predicting Stock Returns using Fama French and CAPM 

- CAPM  describes the relationship between risk and expected return 
- It is built on the earlier work on diversification and modern portfolio theory.
- In simple words, the idea behind CAPM is that investors must compensate in two ways: time value of money and risk.
- It establishes a linear relationship between the asset's expected return and its beta.
